# How to test writting to console

Steam Method

1. Find code that contains writting to console.
```
Console.WriteLine($"Discounts for old student: 35%"); 
```
2. Extract it to separate method. Static method in this case.
```
    public static void WriteLine(string info)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(info);
    }
```
3. Create class and move method to it. 
```
    public class InfoDisplayer : IDisplayer
    {
        public void WriteLine(string info)
        {
        }
    }
```
4. Pass it through constructor that you will create. It should contain single parameter. 
  ```
    public BookingService(InfoDisplayer displayer)
    {
        _displayer = displayer;
    }
  ```  
5. Create interface which single method. This method should have same signature: returned type, name and parameter list. 
```
    public interface IDisplayer
    {
        void WriteLine(string info);
    }
```    
6. Your class should implment this interface.
```
public class InfoDisplayer : IDisplayer
```
7. Change parameter type in our `BookingService.cs` class to interface. 
  ```
    public BookingService(IDisplayer displayer)
    {
        _displayer = displayer;
    }
  ```  
8. Change all 4 occurrences of `BookingService` constructor calls. 
9. Create test class `TestDisplayer` that implements `IDisplayer` it will be used in tests.
```
public class TestDisplayer : IDisplayer
```
10. Create method that will check if proper string was passed as argument to method in our test class. 
```
     Assert.IsTrue(testDisplayer.WasDisplayed("Discounts for student: 25%"));
```
